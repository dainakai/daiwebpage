We have released a Julia package called ParticleHolography.jl. This package is for particle measurement using Gabor holography and inline phase recovery holography, and it allows you to easily perform a series of processes from image preprocessing to visualization.

For more information, please see [GitHub](https://github.com/dainakai/ParticleHolography.jl) and [documentation](https://dainakai.github.io/ParticleHolography.jl/stable/).
