I had the opportunity to give a seminar at Professor Shima's laboratory at the Kobe University of Information Science Campus, University of Hyogo.

Title: "High-speed microparticle measurement using holography and its application to cloud microphysics research"

Abstract:
Holography is an imaging measurement technique that enables the observation of 3D coordinates and shapes of small objects by reconstructing the optical wavefront along the optical axis from the recorded intensity of parallel light. Until now, holographic microparticle measurement has been applied to flow field measurement using PIV and particle size distribution measurement. However, with the advancements in high-speed cameras and GPU performance, measurement with higher temporal resolution is becoming possible. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the principles, methods, and spatial and temporal resolutions of holography, discuss the current state of research aimed at observing droplet collision and coalescence phenomena, and explore other applications.
