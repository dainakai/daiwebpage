In particle measurement using holography, the 3D coordinates of particles are usually obtained by reconstructing a 3D volume through light propagation calculations. However, for close-proximity particle pairs of the same diameter without an optical axis direction distance, the inter-particle distance can be directly obtained from the holographic pattern. In this study, applying the results from the double-exposure holography era, we derived the theoretical equation for close-proximity particle pairs and a distance formula through its discretization, and experimentally verified the formula.
