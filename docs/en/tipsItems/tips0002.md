<!-- CUDA Programming and Inline Holography Reconstruction with Julia -->
<!-- 2024-04-19 -->
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a programming language that combines modern syntax and high-level features with fast execution speed, making it particularly well-suited for numerical computing and data analysis. It is likely to be an especially attractive language for researchers who have done distributed computing (multi-node computations such as supercomputers) using Fortran, and it has many users. Even for those who are not, I think Julia is a very convenient language for simulations, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, Julia provides strong support for CUDA programming, and APIs such as cuFFT and cuBLAS can be used, and the environment setup and execution are very simple. In this article, I will explain how to perform CUDA programming using Julia and perform inline holography computations. I will introduce Julia's CUDA programming methods that take advantage of its features, such as handling multidimensional arrays, defining kernels, and the convenience of broadcasting (which dramatically reduces the amount of kernel writing).
