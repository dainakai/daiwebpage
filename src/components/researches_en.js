                    Holography is a technique that reconstructs the 3D information of an object from the recorded interference pattern of light that has passed through the object of interest. The recorded light field is called a hologram, and the method of recording the hologram using a camera (image sensor) and reconstructing the 3D information is specifically referred to as digital holography.
